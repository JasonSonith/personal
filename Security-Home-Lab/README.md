#  pfSense IDS/IPS Lab with Suricata

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates setting up a pfSense firewall with Suricata IDS/IPS 
to block unsafe traffic (Telnet, brute-force SSH, botnet C2) and log alerts 
for review. The lab simulates real-world attack traffic from Kali Linux to 
an Ubuntu victim machine, routed through pfSense.
